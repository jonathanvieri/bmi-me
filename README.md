BMI Me is a simple BMI calculator app that is created using SwiftUI. It allows you to get BMI value and its advice based on your height and weight.

This project is made to demonstrate the usage of Slider, NavigationView, and GeometryReader in SwiftUI.  
Future improvements will be Saving BMI Results and translating the data into a graph.
